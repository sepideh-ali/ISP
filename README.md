Machine Learning for Enhanced Underground Carbon Storage Research
Project Overview
This repository contains the code and documentation for a project aimed at predicting density measurements in geological carbon storage using Machine Learning (ML). The project involves the use of ML models to forecast crucial physical attributes like density, temperature, pressure, and energy based on data generated through Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations.

Features
Data Preparation: Scripts for parsing and preparing data from MD simulations.
ML Models: Implementation of various ML algorithms, including Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, SVR, Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, and K-Neighbors Regressor.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Utilization of Optuna, PSO, and For-Loop methods for hyperparameter optimization.
Evaluation Metrics: Includes performance evaluation using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (RÂ²).
Visualization: Plots and graphs for analyzing results and model performance.
