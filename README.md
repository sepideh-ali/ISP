Machine Learning for Enhanced Underground Carbon Storage Research
Project Overview
This repository contains the code and documentation for a project aimed at predicting density measurements in geological carbon storage using Machine Learning (ML). The project involves the use of ML models to forecast crucial physical attributes like density, temperature, pressure, and energy based on data generated through Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations.
